This game was built as part of the Godot Wild Jam #66, with the theme: **ESCAPE**. The project is a bit rough due to the rapid prototyping of the jam, of course.

# Controls:

- WASD to move
- Left click to shoot spells or place traps
- Q/E to select a weapon
- 1,2,3,4 to select a trap
- B to begin next wave
- ESC for pause/settings

# Performance

If you're struggling to maintain a good framerate:

- Turn off the outline shader (in the pause menu)
- Turn off shadows (in the pause menu)
- Use the downloadable desktop versions, they will run a lot better than the WebGL export
- MacOS: Avoid the web version

# Tools
- Godot 4.2.1
  - GDScript, since I wanted to target web
- AssetForge
